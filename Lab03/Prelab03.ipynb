Copy in and modify your code as needed from this prelab so that you can calculate the average periods `t_10` and `t_20`, as well as their uncertainties `u_t_10` and `u_t_20`, and relative uncertainties `urel_t_10` and `urel_t_20`. Note that you will need to specify or extract your values for `m_cycles` and `n_trials` to be able to do these calculations.\n",
